ðŸ“– README â€“ Blockchain Poker Smart Contract

Overview

This smart contract implements a provably fair poker game on the Stacks blockchain. It leverages block hashes as seeds for shuffling, ensuring that neither player nor the contract deployer can manipulate the card distribution. The game flow follows standard Texas Holdâ€™em rules: initial hand dealing, flop, turn, river, and declaring a winner.

âœ¨ Features

Provably Fair Shuffling â€“ Uses block hash as a deck seed for reproducibility and fairness.

Game Creation â€“ Players can initiate new games with an opponent and a buy-in.

Hand Dealing â€“ Automatic distribution of two cards to each player.

Community Cards â€“ Flop, turn, and river phases follow sequential game states.

Game State Management â€“ Ensures correct progression (waiting â†’ dealt â†’ flop â†’ turn â†’ river â†’ completed).

Winner Declaration â€“ Either player can end the game by declaring the winner.
